#### Search with the AWS Management Console

In this lab, we explore the search box on the navigation bar, the **search box** that provides a search engine for AWS services and features, documentation, and the AWS Marketplace.

- To open the console for a service, we will use the **search box** in the navigation bar of the AWS Management Console and enter the service name, for example:
``` EC2 ```
- Then, select the EC2 service

Also, we will try to search for another service

- In the **search box** in the navigation bar of AWS Management Console and type ```mongoDB```, we will get the following results:

- **Marketplace** is a curated digital catalog that customers can use to find, buy, deploy, and manage third-party software, data, and services to build solutions and run their businesses.

For example, here are the **MongoDB Atlas** versions for customers to choose and deploy on AWS

- **Blogs** to update the latest technology information and news related to AWS

For example, here are blog posts guiding how to build and connect MongoDB with other AWS services

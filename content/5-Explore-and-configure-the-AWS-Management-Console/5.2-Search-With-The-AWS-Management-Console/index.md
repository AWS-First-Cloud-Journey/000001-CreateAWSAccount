#### Search with the AWS Management Console

In this lab, we will explore the search box on the navigation bar. The **search box** provides a search tool for AWS services and features, documentation, and the AWS Marketplace.

- To open the console for a service, we will use the **search box** in the navigation bar of the AWS Management Console and enter the service name, for example:
``` EC2 ```
- Then, select the EC2 service

Additionally, we will try searching for another service

- In the **search box** in the navigation bar of AWS Management Console, type ```mongoDB```. We will receive results with:

    - **Marketplace** is a curated digital catalog that customers can use to find, buy, deploy, and manage third-party software, data, and services to build solutions and run their businesses.
    
    For example, here are various **MongoDB Atlas** versions for customers to choose from and deploy on AWS

    - **Blogs** to update the latest technology information and news related to AWS

    For example, here are blog posts that guide how to build and connect MongoDB with other AWS services

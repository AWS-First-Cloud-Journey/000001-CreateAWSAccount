"AWS Management Console" helps users securely sign in using **AWS account root user** or **AWS Identity and Access Management** (IAM) credentials.

In addition, although users interact with AWS services through a simple web interface, in reality we are still using tools to make calls to **AWS API**

For more information, please read the following link: [What is the AWS Management Console?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/what-is.html)

#### Overview of AWS Management Console

AWS Management Console provides a secure web interface to access and manage AWS services. It supports authentication through both AWS account root user credentials and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials.

> **ℹ️ Information**  
> Although AWS Management Console provides a user-friendly web interface, all interactions are converted to AWS API calls behind the scenes.

For more detailed information, refer to: [What is the AWS Management Console?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/what-is.html)

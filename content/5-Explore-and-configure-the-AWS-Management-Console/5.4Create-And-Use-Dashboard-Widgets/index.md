#### Create and use dashboard widgets

In this lab, let's explore "widgets" that display important information about our AWS environment and provide shortcuts to AWS services.

We can customize our experience by adding and removing these widgets, rearranging them, or resizing them to a custom size

Select the AWS logo in the left corner of the screen to return to **Console Home**

- In addition, the remaining **widgets** such as: **Managed instances, Ops summary, Patch compliance,** do not show the corresponding values ​​and AWS has instructed to **Go to Systems Manager, Go to OpsCenter, Go to Patch Manager** to set up

Note: **Managed instances, Ops summary, Patch compliance,** are all part of AWS Systems Manager, you can learn more via the link [What is AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html)

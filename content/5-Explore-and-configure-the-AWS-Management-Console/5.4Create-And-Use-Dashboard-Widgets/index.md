#### Create and use dashboard widgets

In this lab, we will explore "display widgets" that show important information about our AWS environment and provide shortcuts to AWS services.

We can customize our experience by adding and removing these widgets, rearranging them, or resizing them as needed.

Select the AWS logo in the left corner of the screen to return to **Console Home**

- To add widgets, select the **+ Add widgets** icon in the right corner of the screen

- The **Add widgets** window is displayed on the right side of the screen

- In the **Add widgets** menu, select the widget title that you want to add, then drag that **widget** onto the dashboard.
- For example: the "recently visited services" widget **(Recently visited)**

- Move **widgets** to a new position on the dashboard

- Customize the size of **widgets**

- Additionally, other **widgets** such as: **Managed instances, Ops summary, Patch compliance** do not yet display corresponding values, and AWS has provided guidance to **Go to Systems Manager, Go to OpsCenter, Go to Patch Manager** for setup

Note: **Managed instances, Ops summary, Patch compliance** are all part of the AWS Systems Manager service. You can learn more through the link [What is AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html)

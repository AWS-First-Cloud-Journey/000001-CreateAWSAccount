#### Introduction

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an important security layer for your AWS account. By requiring a second authentication factor in addition to your password, MFA protects your AWS account from unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

#### Benefits of MFA

- **Enhanced Security**: Requires a second authentication factor beyond password
- **Risk Reduction**: Protects account even when login credentials are compromised
- **Compliance**: Meets security compliance requirements of many organizations

#### Supported MFA Device Types

##### 1. Virtual MFA Device

Uses an authenticator app on your smartphone to generate OTP (One-Time Password) codes.

**Supported Applications:**
- Microsoft Authenticator
- Google Authenticator
- Okta Verify
- Authy

##### 2. U2F Security Key

Physical security key that follows the FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) standard.

**Supported Devices:**
- YubiKey
- Feitian
- HyperFIDO

##### 3. Other Hardware MFA Device

Hardware device that generates authentication codes.

**Supported Devices:**
- Gemalto SafeNet IDProve
- RSA SecurID

#### Troubleshooting

##### Lost MFA Device

If you lose access to your MFA device:

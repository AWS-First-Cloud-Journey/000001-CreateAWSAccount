During the AWS account creation process, at the contact phone number verification step, sometimes you may not receive SMS messages or calls from AWS. In that case, follow these steps to complete the account information verification:

#### Check Information

First, double-check your account information and ensure it has been entered correctly:
- You have entered the phone number information and selected the correct international country code to receive the call.
- If you are using a mobile phone, check your phone to ensure you are still within coverage area to receive calls.
- Payment method information has been entered correctly.

Make sure that the phone number you provide in your AWS account is reachable.
